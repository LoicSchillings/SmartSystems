# PC-Based AI vs Jetson Nano AI

This project includes **two different AI implementations**: one running on a **NVIDIA Jetson Nano** and one on a **PC**.

## Jetson Nano–Based AI
- This was the **main focus of the project and assignment**
- Designed to run on **embedded hardware**
- Uses a camera for live input
- Required optimization due to **limited RAM and system resources**
- Final implementation runs outside Jupyter Notebooks using a virtual environment

## PC-Based AI
- Created **purely out of interest and for testing purposes**
- **Not part of the original project or assignment**
- Runs on a standard PC with significantly more resources
- Used to experiment, test ideas, and validate AI logic without hardware limitations

## Summary
The **Jetson Nano AI** represents the real target system with strict hardware constraints, while the **PC-based AI** served as an experimental and testing platform to explore and validate concepts.
